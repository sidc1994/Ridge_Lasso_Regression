## General Information
Aim is to predict price of a house property in Australian Market using various parameters of the property as per the database and to
arrive at an optimum value of the property.
The database is a dataset of 1460 properties along with the Current actual selling price of the property which is the target variable for this problem statement.
Ridge and Lasso regression is used to build the model

## Conclusions
Optimum value of alpha is chossen and indicated in the code file for both lasso and ridge regression.
